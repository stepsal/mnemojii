# Dislaimer 
Use at own risk. Only a fraction (2.5%) of the 2048 words have an emoji mapping. This means there is a higher chance of a succesful brute force attack.


# Background
- Experiments on trading security for useability in mnemonic seed phrases.


# Randomness
- Its as random as the random function in python. No entropy, none of that fancy stuff


# Mapping
- The 100 seed words mapped have universally clear corresponding Emojis.
- You can increase / modify this mapping by updating emojiimap.json
- Always run a visual confirmation on any mappings you add.


# Uses
- Cute backup phrases for very young or very old people.
- Gas less transactions via IM :P
